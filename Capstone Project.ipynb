    "Imagine that we work for a restaurant chain that has restaurants all over the world. We want to open a restaurant in Barcelona and for this we want to find a neighborhood where there are as many possible customers while having as little competition as possible. The Stakeholders want to find a Neighboorhood with a good income and with few venues, so they could maximize their profits when opening the restaurant."

Once we have this dataset, we will use Foursquare to obtain the information and location abou the venues in each neighborhood. After that, we will be able to make a decision about the location of the new restaurant. "
